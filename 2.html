                From the very first moment we connected back in 2021, even though it was through a screen, there was something about you that stood out. And now, after all this time and as my feelings for you have grown, I can’t help but notice just how truly special you are. <br>

Your Smile: It’s like sunshine breaking through even the longest distance—warm, comforting, and impossible to ignore. <br>

Your Eyes: Even though I haven’t seen them in person, I can imagine the kindness and joy they carry, just from the way you talk and laugh. <br>

Your Hair: Your short hairstyle? It’s unique, effortless, and honestly, it’s become one of my favorite things about you. <br>

<br> Every little thing about you—your laughter, your words, and the way you brighten my days—makes the miles between us feel a little smaller. And the fact that you don’t use social media (like Insta and all🙃)? That’s just another reason you stand out in a world full of noise.

I don’t know if you fully realize just how amazing you are, but I want to make sure you do. You’re truly one of a kind, Sugyani, and someone I like in a way I never expected. 🌟
