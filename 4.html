                    I don‚Äôt know where to start, but I‚Äôll try my best to share what‚Äôs been on my mind lately. Over the past few days, I‚Äôve noticed something changing within me‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt see coming. After 3.5 years of knowing you, of sharing laughter and moments that mean so much, I‚Äôve found myself feeling something more.

                    It‚Äôs only recently that I realized just how much you mean to me, and it‚Äôs been impossible to ignore. You‚Äôve always been special to me, but now, it feels different‚Äîlike the kind of special that makes my heart race a little faster and my mind drift to you even more often.
                    
                    I created this website because words alone weren‚Äôt enough to say what I‚Äôve been feeling. You‚Äôve inspired me, made my days brighter, and shown me what it means to have a connection so rare and meaningful.
                    
                    I don‚Äôt expect anything from this, but I wanted you to know the truth: You are someone I care about deeply, and these feelings are something I couldn‚Äôt keep to myself anymore.
                    
                    If nothing else, I hope this makes you smile and reminds you of just how incredible you are.  </font>
