            <p class="fade-in">I’ve poured my heart into this website to show you just how much you mean to me, It took me almost 7 days to build this website. Over the years, you’ve become the most important part of my life—my best friend, my source of joy, and now, someone I care about in ways I never imagined.

                This isn’t just a confession; it’s a wish—a hope that what we share could grow into something even more beautiful. I know this website might come as a surprise, but I needed you to know how I feel.
                
                If you feel the same way, even a little, I’d love to explore what “us” could mean. And if you don’t, that’s okay too—our bond means the world to me, and nothing will change that.
                
                No matter what, thank you for being you, for being my light, and for making every day better just by being in it.
                <b> <u>I used to think different about you before about 15 days ago, now i feel different idk why😭</u> </b>
